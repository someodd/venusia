-- | This module provides a file watcher that intelligently handles file change
-- events.
--
-- The main challenge with file watching is that a single "save" action can
-- create a storm of low-level system events. This watcher solves that problem by
-- "debouncing" the stormâ€”it reacts only to the first event and ignores all
-- others for a set period, ensuring a command runs only once per actual change.

-- | Watches a directory for file changes and runs a hook.
--
-- This function is the heart of the module. It solves the "event storm"
-- problem by using an 'MVar' as a gatekeeper.
--
-- === How it Works
--
-- 1. An event arrives.
-- 2. The watcher tries to grab a lock ('MVar').
-- 3. If it gets the lock, it starts a timer in a new thread ('forkIO').
-- 4. If it *doesn't* get the lock, it means another event is already being
-- handled, so it does nothing.
-- 5. After the timer finishes, the command runs and the lock is released,
-- ready for the next change.
--
-- This function is designed to be the main action of a program and will
-- run forever, so it will block the calling thread.
